            [- Version 2.1.5 -]
2005-12-30: When installing YTools, if YTFM is not yet installed, user
            is queried whether it should be installed, but is no
            longer asked the confusing question about whether YTFM
            should be loaded; the load now happens willy-nilly.
            Post-file-transduction hooks are now run in reverse chrono
            order. 
            Replaced occurrences of (set sym val) with (!=
            (Symbol-value sym) val) in tracearound to make CLISP
            happy. 

            [- Version 2.1.4 -]
2005-12-28: Allow '_' in (repeat :for ((_ = l :to h)) ...).

            [- Version 2.1.3 2005/12/26 15:33:18 airfoyle Exp -]
2005-12-26: Add 'sym-val' to debug.lisp.

            [- Version 2.1.2 2005/12/26 15:21:44 airfoyle Exp -]
2005-12-25: Merge chunk-based YTools into main line!
            
            [- Version 2.0.61 -]
2005-12-24: Allow '+' or '-' as responses to question about whether a
            file should be loaded after being compiled.  Fix paren
            error in 'track-extra-vals' (multilet.lisp).  To make
            "fcompl -f" work correctly for ytools module, added every
            component of the module to the definition in module.lisp.

            [- Version 2.0.59 2005/12/23 05:59:18 airfoyle Exp]
2005-12-22: Made 'fcompl' work with modules --- sort of.

2005-12-21: Fixed bug in 'read-y-or-n' (outin.lisp) where output was
            going to standard output instead of 'srm'. 
            
2005-12-17: Corrected anachronisms in slurp.lisp (use of != and *-*).

            [- Version 2.0.57 2005/12/17 15:49:41 airfoyle Exp -]
2005-12-15: Rewrite of 'track-extra-vals/extra-vals' for greater
            flexibility, adding keyword args :num-principal-values,
            :after; and allowing 'vars' in 'extra-vals' to be omitted
            in simple cases.  Manual and implementation now agree.

            [- Version 2.0.56 2005/12/14 20:30:42 airfoyle Exp]
2005-12-14: Altered 'cons-funcall' to allow (lambda ...) as well as
            (\\ ...).  Changed name of 'mapeltreduce' to 'mapreduce',
            and made it macroexpand to 'reduce' in the usual case.

            [- Version 2.0.55 2005/12/14 15:21:38 airfoyle Exp -]
2005-12-13: Made 'track-extra-vals' more complex for no real reason.

            [- Version 2.0.54 2005/12/12 16:27:42 airfoyle Exp]
2005-12-09: Changed def-class so that a "key-conser" is always
            defined, even if the option :nokey was given.  That option
            was undocumented, and has now been emasculated, that is,
            made equivalent to the absence of :key.

            [- Version 2.0.50 Id: 1.31.2.50 2005/12/08 17:03:04 airfoyle Exp -]
2005-12-08: New numbering scheme: Minor version number of software
            package = last version number for CHANGELOG of package
            E.g., this entry bumps the YTools CHANGELOG to version
            1.31.2.50, so this produces version 2.0.50 of YTools.

2005-12-06: Added instrumentation to tell when 'multilet' expands to
            simple or complex version.

2005-12-04: !' now records symbols it is used with in list
            syms-used-as-funktions*

2005-11-30: Added feature :ytools back to *features* (somehow it had
            disappeared at some point).

2005-11-23: Allow extra atoms at front of 'control-nest' as comments.
            Slight tuning of initialization protocol.  New
            quasi-public routine 'new-source-suffix' for adding
            strings to 'source-suffixes*'.  

2005-11-20: Added debugging aid in chunk. Eliminated error break in
            'chunks-update' after careful experimentation showed that
            it is perfectly possible for 'set-latest-supporter-date'
            to make a chunk out of date after it has been derived.

2005-11-13: Fixed bug in 'def-ytools-logical-pathname' that caused old
            bin-directory association to be discarded if no
            association was specified.

            Moved fileseg into ytools directory.
            (Version 2.0.17)

2005-11-09: Corrected error in compiler macro for 'string-concat'.
            (Version 2.0.16)

2005-11-08: Small change to raw-ytfm-load.

2005-11-06: Switched order of loading init files so that
            config-directory ytinit (if any) is loaded before home-dir
            ytinit (if any).

2005-11-03: Changed 'bind' so it doesn't declare built-in globals as
            special.  'string-concat' moved from nilscompat.lisp to base.lisp
            (Version 2.0.15)

2005-10-31: Export 'fload-version-suffix*' because it's mentioned in
            the manual.

2005-10-26: Changed 'temporarily-manage' in chunks-update so it makes
            management request even if a chunk is already managed.
            (See comment in that function.)

2005-10-21: Added calls to 'force-output' to make queries work
            properly under SBCL.  Changed parameter
            ytools-bin-dir-pathname* in ytools.lsy to allow
            non-relative bin directory for YTools.
            
2005-10-19: Fixed bug in 'declare-pathname-associate'

2005-10-11: Replaced calls to 'file-write-date' with calls to
            'pathname-write-time' in cases where file is not known to
            exist.  (Version 2.0.13.)

2005-10-10: Workarounds for bugs in Open MCL.

2005-10-09: Creating Ever-loaded chunks; not integrated yet (or
            working correctly, for that matter).  Corrected various
            technicalities to get Open MCL to compile YTools.  Created
            simple repl (repl.lisp) for use in slime debugger.

2005-10-07: Allowed names of config files to be something other than
            "ytconfig.lisp".  Broadened declarations of allowed values
            of fields in chunks to make openmcl compiler happy.

2005-09-13: Moved facilities of multvalhacks.lisp into multilet.lisp.
            Changed 'loadeds-check-bases' so it postpones rescans if
            chunk update is already in progress. (Version 2.0.12)

2005-09-03: Inserted :before method for (setf Chunk-date) on
            Code-file-chunk to try to catch the mysterious culprit
            that occasionally tries to set a Code-file-chunk's date to
            something before its file's write date.  No hit so far.

2005-07-29: Added 'on-list-if-new', *current-case-mode*

2005-07-28: Allowed derivers and date-derivers to terminate management
            of their chunks if found to be defective in some way;
            chunks-update will then skip any further handling of them.
	    This is used in the case of code-file chunks for
            nonexistent files.
	    'fload' and 'fcompl' now remind user if there are
            postponed file ops. (Version 2.0.11)

2005-07-24: Added 'with-open-files' to multvalhacks.lisp.
	    Revamped the way file-header slurping is related to chunk
            for file being slurped.  (Version 2.0.10)

2005-07-21: Replaced <- and *undef with :<- and :*undef in filedeps.lisp.

2005-06-30: Changed naming convention for form chunks derived from
            modules, so that redefining module erases the old form
            chunk rather than just adding a new one.

2005-06-24: Moved keyword-args-extract to misc.lisp.  Add 'in-header'
            (file depend.lisp). Fixed bug in fload (so -x flag
            works). (Version 2.0.09.)

2005-06-17: Added file multvalhacks.lisp .  (Version 2.0.08)
            Add feature pre-chunk, so that .lsy files can run under
            either old YTools or YTools 2. Added file
            multvalhacks.lisp. (Version 1.4.9)

2005-05-30: Added 'find-chunk'.  Fixed bug in 'chunk-destroy'.  Fixed
            bugs in request-mgt logic.  Added some debugging
            statements.  Changed chunk printer.

2005-05-28: Made flags in 'fload' and 'fcompl' characters, not symbols
            interned in the yt package.  Added -n flag (force
            "normality"). 

2005-05-27: Made scan for "Readtable: " in mode line case-insensitive.

2005-05-04: Gave user options in case fload reports that previous
            attempt to compile a file failed.  (Version 2.0.06)

2005-05-03: Introduced chunk for pathname associates.
            Dir-associate-chunk (pathname.lisp) keeps track of the
            association of a property with a pathname.
            Compiled-file-chunks depend on association of 'bin'
            properties with directories. (Version 2.0.05)

2005-04-20: Ensured that if bin directory of a source directory
            changes, fload will notice that the next time it compiles
            a file in the source directory.  (Version 2.0.04)            

2005-04-17: Eliminated double-compilation bug in (fload -c ...).
            Suppressed annoying message about chunk times differing by
            1 second.  Fixed bug preventing proper reset of basis by
            'loaded-chunk-set-basis'.  Made sure scan-depends-on is
            preceded by reset of bases of all relevant
            chunks. (Version 2.0.03)

2005-04-16: Eliminated bug in logic in 'loaded-chunk-set-basis'.
            (Version 2.0.02)

2005-04-06: Added slurp handlers for various forms. (Version 2.0.01)

2005-03-27: Rethink of alt-version hack for Code-file-chunks.
            Reintroduced idea from old YTools of having lightweight
            version control apply purely at the file-list-parsing
            level (e.g., in parsing the arguments to 'fload').

            Got slurp dependencies right (or more nearly right) in
            file chunks.

2005-03-16: Rethink of what it means to slurp a module definition.            
	    Corrected bug in implementation of -x flag to 'fload'.

2005-03-13: Debugged interaction between 'depends-on' and
            'self-compile-dep'. More tuning of ynisp to new chunk
            system.  

2005-03-12: Better cycle detection in chunk network.  Implemented
            'at-slurp-time' dependencies.

2005-03-06: Further debugging of flags to fload and fcompl.  (Version 1.5.1)

2005-03-05: One more retune of derive-date/derive ritual.  
	    Made interrogation about what version of files to load
            more intelligible.  Began work on getting force flags to
            work correctly.  (Version 1.5)

2005-03-02: Split derivers into two generic functions, derive-date and
            derive.  Leaf chunks can be out of date.  'derive' is
            called the same way for leaves and non-leaves. (Version
            1.4.11) 

2005-02-27: Yet another scheme for controlling chunk updates triggered
            by chunk derivers: The interrupt is detected by the outer
            update, which is then restarted.  The inner update does
            not happen again because derivers are called only once at
            a particular level.

	    Added ability to postpone updates of derivees, to avoid
            repeated updates of the same irrelevant downstream derivee
            during debugging of upstream chunk. (Version 1.4.10)

2005-01-25: Add utility 'stream-indent' to outin.lisp

2004-11-07: Resurrected 'intercept' and 'pass' with improved type
            checking.  Altered 'ytools-logical-pathname-def' so it
            returns a second argument (the 'obj-version' of the
            pathname) (Version 1.4.8.7)

2004-10-30: Changed output for warning message in 'decipher-readtable'
            (slurp.lisp). (Version 1.4.8.6)

2004-10-29: Wrapped #+openmcl around code referring to ccl
            package. (Version 1.4.8.5.)

2004-10-26: Fixed bug in outin whereby nonstreams were making it into
            the variable 'out-streams*' (probably because Allegro does
            something odd to streams when it closes them).  (Version
            1.4.8.4)

2004-10-05: One more tweak to logic of 'compilable' in
            lprec-check-compile. (Version 1.4.8.3)

2004-10-04: Fixed bugs introduced by fixes of 10-02. 
	    Added second value returned by
            'ytools-logical-pathname-def' (the bin directory)
	    (Version 1.4.8.2)

2004-10-02: Replaced 'lisp:' with 'cl:' in a couple of files.
            Stopped 'fload' from trying to compile files with types
            other than Lisp source. (Version 1.4.8)

2004-10-01: Define 'ytools-logical-pathname-def' to make it easy to
            find the definition of a YTools logical pathname. (Version 1.4.7)

2004-09-29: Added convenience function (in-ytools), which sets
            *package* and *readtable* to their proper YTools
            values. (Version 1.4.6)

2004-09-26: Patch 'subr-synonym' to cope with bug in OpenMCL.
            (Version 1.4.5)

2004-09-19: Define 'is-list' in base.lisp as synonym for 'listp'.
            Minor change to 'datafun-table' in datafun.lisp.

2004-09-16: Added field :initbind e to (x :in l) clause of
            'repeat'. The expression e is evaluated and bound to x
            initially.  This is purely to satisfy some compilers that
            complain if x is declared to be of some type incompatible
            with an initial value of nil.  (Version 1.4.4)

2004-09-11: Change 'ytools-module-load' in module.lisp so that
            expansion of module is evalualated when module is loaded.

2004-09-02: Replace 'assoc' with 'assq' in expansion of 'alist-entry'
            (to avoid confusing Nisp). (Version 1.4.3)

2004-08-22: Interaction between 'outin' and pretty-printer streamlined.
	
2004-08-11: Stuff after :proceed and :prompt-for is now a list of args
            suitable for 'out'.  In the case of :prompt-for, the last
	    element is the default, and the out-args don't include that
	    last element.
	
2004-08-09: Change in bq.lisp to allow other files to use its facilities.
	    Invisible to users.  Changed logic in 'fload' so after asking
	    whether to compile a previously uncompiled file it doesn't
	    consider loading old (nonexistent) object code.  (Version 1.4.2)
	
2004-08-06: Introduced :|| as prettier synonym for :\|
	
2004-08-03: Altered implementation of '!' dispatch macro; change
            invisible to users.  Another invisible change to
            subr-synonym (allows specification of numargs).
	
2004-07-30: Made ytdoc.pdf part of the CVS system, so it will be part of
            the "nightly snapshot."  (Version 1.4.1)
	
2004-07-25: Adding 'nthrest'
	
2004-07-10: Simplified Qvar as type	
	
2004-07-09: Added gen-var
	
2004-07-06: Tiny bug fix in setter
	
2004-06-25: Further enhancements to alref. .  Made packages work in
	    names of YTools logical pathnames.  Fixed bug in 'repeat'
	    for var notation (v e0 :then e1) so it's the same as (v =
	    e0 :then e1).  Got 'fload-recheck' working correctly.
	    Version 1.4
	
2004-06-24: Improved definition of 'alref.' so it allows specification
            of equality test, access method, and new-entry builder.
	    Allow package names to occur inside YTools logical pathnames.
	
2004-04-20: Added 'val-or-initialize' and its notational variant,
            'memoize-val', to misc.  Tightened definitions of 'alref' and
	    'alref.' .
	
2004-03-14: Added debug.lisp
	
2004-03-09: Changes for portability.
	
2003-12-17: (branch ytools-1-2-dev) Rejiggered logic to checking
	    whether to recompile in files.lisp.  Eventually this will be
	    right, by the monkeys-and-typewriters theorem.
	
2003-12-11: (branch ytools-1-2-dev) Rewrote file-update checker to get
            right the logic of when to recompile or reload a file.
	
2003-11-08: Slight change to an error message in pathname.lisp.
	
2003-10-28: Changed ytload.lisp to allow .lmd files to be in arbitrary places
	
2003-10-27: Eliminated Allegro check in depend.lisp"
	
2003-10-26: Added 'ytcopy.lisp' utility
	
2003-08-24: Declared var fload-compile* properly.
	    Better y-n query handling in one place
	    Still struggling with precise definition of 'depends-on'
	
2003-08-15: Slight reorganization of 'repeat.lisp' to split some local
	    functions off so they can be used elsewhere.
	
2003-08-14: Changed handling of datafuns on property lists, adding
            'datafun-on-plist'.
	    In mapper.lisp, had to explicitly declare that 'mapmac'
	    property is stored on symbol plists.  Ditto for 'match-code'
	    property in setter.lisp.
	    Slight bug fix in setter.lisp
	
2003-08-06: Fixed bug in pathname.lisp	    
	
2003-08-03: Added '--' to base.lisp
	
2003-07-13: Replaced :continue with :proceed in 'signal-problem'.  Made
            the string after :proceed evaluable.
