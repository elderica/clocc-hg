2003-12-17: (branch ytools-1-2-dev) Rejiggered logic to checking

            right the logic of when to recompile or reload a file.

2003-08-15: Slight reorganization of 'repeat.lisp' to split some local
	    functions off so they can be used elsewhere.
	
2003-08-14: Changed handling of datafuns on property lists, adding
            'datafun-on-plist'.
	    In mapper.lisp, had to explicitly declare that 'mapmac'
	    property is stored on symbol plists.  Ditto for 'match-code'
	    property in setter.lisp.
	    Slight bug fix in setter.lisp
	
2003-08-06: Fixed bug in pathname.lisp
