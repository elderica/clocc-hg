This is a 'get it out of the door' release. The subsystems included have patches 
that still have to be integrated with upstream.

Expect a more polished release soon. But in the mean time I would appriciate
bugreports on this release. If you do encounter problems, please recompile
with debug 3 and send a traceback.
