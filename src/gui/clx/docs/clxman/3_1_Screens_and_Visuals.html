    <P>
      An X display supports graphical output to one or more <I>screens</I>. 
      Each screen has its own root window and window hierarchy. Each window 
      belongs to exactly one screen and cannot simultaneously appear on 
      another screen.
    <P>
      The kinds of graphics hardware used by X screens can vary greatly in 
      their support for color and in their methods for accessing raster 
      memory. X uses the concept of a <I>visual</I> <I>type</I> (usually 
      referred to simply as a <I>visual</I>) which uniquely identifies the 
      hardware capabilities of a display screen. Fundamentally, a visual is 
      represented by a <A HREF='1_6_Data_Types.html#card29'><B>card29</B></A> 
      integer ID, which uniquely identifies the visual type relative to a 
      single display. CLX also represents a visual with a <A
       HREF='1_6_Data_Types.html#visual-info'><B>visual-info</B></A> 
      structure that contains other attributes associated with a visual (see 
      paragraph 1.6, Data Types). A screen can support more than one depth 
      (that is, pixel size), and for each supported depth, a screen may 
      support more than one visual. However, it is more typical for a screen 
      to have only a single depth and a single visual type.
    <P>
      A visual represents various aspects of the screen hardware, as follows:
    <UL>
      <LI>
        A screen can be color or gray-scale.
      <LI>
        A screen can have a colormap that is either writable or read-only.
      <LI>
        A screen can have a single colormap or separate colormaps for each of 
        the red, green, and blue components. With separate colormaps, a pixel 
        value is decomposed into three parts to determine indexes into each 
        of the red, green, and blue colormaps.
    </UL>
     
    <P>
      CLX supports the following classes of visual types: <B>:direct-color</B>
      , <B>:gray-scale</B>, <B>:pseudo-color</B>, <B>:static-color</B>, <B>
      :static-gray</B>, and <B>:true-color</B>. The following tables show how 
      the characteristics of a screen determine the class of its visual type.
    <P>
      For screens with a single colormap:
    <TABLE BORDER='1'>
      <TR>
        <TD>
        <TH>
          Color
        <TH>
          Gray-Scale
      <TR>
        <TH>
          Read-only
        <TD><B>:static-color</B>
        <TD><B>:static-gray</B>
      <TR>
        <TH>
          Writable
        <TD><B>:pseudo-color</B>
        <TD><B>:gray-scale</B>
    </TABLE>
     
    <P>
      For screens with red, green, and blue colormaps:
    <TABLE BORDER='1'>
      <TR>
        <TH>
          Read-only
        <TD><B>:true-color</B>
      <TR>
        <TH>
          Writable
        <TD><B>:direct-color</B>
        <TD><B>:gray-scale</B>
    </TABLE>
     
    <P>
      The visual class also indicates how screen colormaps are handled. See 
      paragraph 9.1, Colormaps and Colors.
