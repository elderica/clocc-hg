        <B>obscure</B>
      <DD>
        A window is <I>obscured</I> if some other window obscures it. For 
        example, window A obscures window B if: 
        <UL>
          <LI>
            Both windows are viewable <B>:input-output</B> windows
          <LI>
            Window A is higher in the global stacking order than window B
          <LI>
            The rectangle defined by the outside edges of window A intersects 
            the rectangle defined by the outside edges of window B
        </UL>
         
        <P>
          Notice that window borders are included in the calculation, and 
          that a window can be obscured and yet still have visible regions. 
          See occlude (there is a fine distinction between obscure and 
          occlude).
      <DT>
        <B>occlude</B>
      <DD>
        A window is <I>occluded</I> if some other window occludes it. For 
        example, window A occludes window B if: 
        <UL>
          <LI>
            Both windows are mapped
          <LI>
            Window A is higher in the global stacking order than window B
          <LI>
            The rectangle defined by the outside edges of window A intersects 
            the rectangle defined by the outside edges of window B
        </UL>
         
        <P>
          Notice that window borders are included in the calculation. See 
          obscure (there is a fine distinction between occlude and obscure).
      <DT>
        <B>override-shell</B>
      <DD>
        A subclass of <B>shell</B> used to override the window manager. This 
        subclass contains pop-up menus and other temporary objects that the 
        user can never resize and so on.
