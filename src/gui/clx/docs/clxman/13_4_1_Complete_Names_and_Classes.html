    <P>
      A resource binding contains a resource name list that can contain 
      names, class names, or a mixture of both. A class name is a symbol or 
      string that represents a group of related objects. The set of names 
      used as class names are not specified by CLX. Instead, class names are 
      defined by agreement between those who use class names when creating 
      resource bindings (that is, users) and those who use class names when 
      accessing resource values (that is, application programmers).
    <P>
      In order to access a value in a resource database, an application uses 
      a key consisting of two items: a <I>complete resource name</I> and a <I>
      complete resource class</I>. A complete resource name is a resource 
      name list containing no wildcard elements. A complete resource class is 
      a list of exactly the same form. The distinction between a complete 
      resource name and a complete resource class lies in how they are used 
      to access resource bindings. The elements of a complete resource name 
      are interpreted as names of individual objects; the elements of a 
      complete resource class are interpreted as names of object classes. The 
      complete resource name and class lists used in a resource database 
      access must have the same length.
    <P>
      Like any resource name list, a complete resource name consists of a 
      path list and an attribute name. The first path list element is 
      typically a symbol (or string) identifying the application as a whole. 
      The second element can be a screen root identifier. Subsequent elements 
      can be identifiers for each ancestor window of an application window. 
      Thus, a path list typically identifies a specific window by tracing a 
      path to it through the application window hierarchy. The final element 
      of a complete resource name (its attribute name) is typically the name 
      of a specific attribute of the window given by the path list (for 
      example, <CODE>&#39;background</CODE>). An attribute name can refer to 
      a feature associated with the window by the application but not by the 
      X server (for example, a font identifier). Similarly, a complete 
      resource class typically represents a path to a window in the 
      application window hierarchy and a specific window attribute. However, 
      a complete resource class contains the class name for each window and 
      for the window attribute.
    <P>
      For instance, in the previous example, the <CODE>mail</CODE> 
      application can attempt to look up the value of the <CODE>background
      </CODE> resource for the <CODE>reply button</CODE> window by using the 
      following complete resource name:
    <P>
      <CODE>(mail screen-1 reply background)</CODE>
    <P>
      and the following complete resource class:
    <P>
      <CODE>(application root button fill)</CODE>
    <P>
      This complete resource name contains a path list identifying the reply 
      button window -- <CODE>(mail screen-1 reply)</CODE> -- and an attribute 
      name for the window background. The corresponding resource class 
      contains the class names for the same path list and window attribute.
