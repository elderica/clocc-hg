        <B>padding</B>
      <DD>
        Some padding bytes are inserted in the data stream to maintain 
        alignment of the protocol requests on natural boundaries. This 
        increases ease of portability to some machine architectures.
      <DT>
        <B>parent window</B>
      <DD>
        If C is a child of P, then P is the <I>parent</I> of C.
      <DT>
        <B>passive grab</B>
      <DD>
        Grabbing a key or button is a <I>passive grab</I>. The grab activates 
        when the key or button is actually pressed.
      <DT>
        <B>pixel value</B>
      <DD>
        An <I>n</I>-bit value, where <I>n</I> is the number of bit planes 
        used in (that is, the depth of) a particular window or pixmap. For a 
        window, a pixel value indexes a colormap to derive an actual color to 
        be displayed.
      <DT>
        <A HREF='1_6_Data_Types.html#pixmap'><B>pixmap</B></A>
      <DD>
        A three dimensional array of bits. A pixmap is normally thought of as 
        a two dimensional array of pixels, where each pixel can be a value 
        from 0 to (2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP>)-1, where <I>n</I> is the depth (z 
        axis) of the pixmap. A pixmap can also be thought of as a stack of <I>
        n</I> bitmaps.
      <DT>
        <B>plane</B>
      <DD>
        When a pixmap or window is thought of as a stack of bitmaps, each 
        bitmap is called a <I>plane</I> or <I>bit plane</I>.
      <DT>
        <B>plane mask</B>
      <DD>
        Graphics operations can be restricted to only affect a subset of bit 
        planes of a destination. A <I>plane mask</I> is a bit mask describing 
        which planes are to be modified, and it is stored in a graphics 
        context.
      <DT>
        <B>pointer</B>
      <DD>
        The pointing device attached to the cursor and tracked on the screens.
      <DT>
        <B>pointer grabbing</B>
      <DD>
        A client can actively <I>grab</I> control of the pointer, and button 
        and motion events will be sent to that client rather than the client 
        to which the events would normally have been sent.
      <DT>
        <B>pointing device</B>
      <DD>
        Typically a mouse or tablet, or some other device with effective 
        dimensional motion. There is only one visible cursor defined by the 
        core protocol, and it tracks whatever pointing device is attached as 
        the pointer.
      <DT>
        <B>pop-up</B>
      <DD>
        One of the uses of a top-level shell (for example, a menu that pops 
        up when a command button contact is activated). Setting the <B>state
        </B> of a shell to <B>:mapped</B> is sometimes referred to as <I>
        mapping</I> or <I>popping up</I> the shell. Setting the <B>state</B> 
        of a shell to <B>:withdrawn</B> or <B>:iconic</B> is sometimes 
        referred to as <I>unmapping</I> or <I>popping down</I> the shell.
      <DT>
        <B>property</B>
      <DD>
        Windows can have associated <I>properties</I>, consisting of a name, 
        a type, a data format, and some data. The protocol places no 
        interpretation on properties; they are intended as a general-purpose 
        naming mechanism for clients. For example, clients might share 
        information such as resize hints, program names, and icon formats 
        with a window manager via properties.
      <DT>
        <B>property list</B>
      <DD>
        The list of properties that have been defined for a window.
      <DT>
        <B>pseudo color</B>
      <DD>
        A class of colormap in which a pixel value indexes the colormap to 
        produce independent red, green, and blue values. That is, the 
        colormap is viewed as an array of triples (RGB values). The RGB 
        values can be changed dynamically.
