    <P>
      In X, a <I>color</I> is defined by a set of three numeric values, 
      representing intensities of red, green, and blue. Red, green, and blue 
      are referred to as the <I>primary</I> hues. A <I>colormap</I> is a list 
      of colors, each indexed by an integer <I>pixel</I> value. Each entry in 
      a colormap is called a color <I>cell</I>. Raster graphics displays 
      store pixel values in a special screen hardware memory. As the screen 
      hardware scans this memory, it reads each pixel value, looks up the 
      color in the corresponding cell of a colormap, and displays the color 
      on its screen.
    <P>
      The colormap abstraction applies to all classes of visual types 
      supported by X, including those for screens which are actually 
      monochrome. For example, <B>:gray-scale</B> screens use colormaps in 
      which colors actually specify the monochrome intensity. A typical 
      black-and-white monochrome display has a <B>:static-gray</B> screen 
      with a two-cell colormap.
    <P>
      The following list describes how pixel values and colormaps are handled 
      for each visual class.
    <DL>
      <DT>
        <B>:direct-color</B>
      <DD>
        A pixel value is decomposed into separate red, green, and blue 
        subfields. Each subfield indexes a separate colormap. Entries in all 
        colormaps can be changed.
      <DT>
        <B>:gray-scale</B>
      <DD>
        A pixel value indexes a single colormap that contains monochrome 
        intensities. Colormap entries can be changed.
      <DT>
        <B>:pseudo-color</B>
      <DD>
        A pixel value indexes a single colormap that contains color 
        intensities. Colormap entries can be changed.
      <DT>
        <B>:static-color</B>
      <DD>
        Same as <B>:pseudo-color</B>, except that the colormap entries are 
        predefined by the hardware and cannot be changed.
      <DT>
        <B>:static-gray</B>
      <DD>
        Same as <B>:gray-scale</B>, except that the colormap entries are 
        predefined by the hardware and cannot be changed.
      <DT>
        <B>:true-color</B>
      <DD>
        Same as <B>:direct-color</B>, except that the colormap entries are 
        predefined by the hardware and cannot be changed. Typically, each of 
        the red, green, and blue colormaps provides a (near) linear ramp of 
        intensity.
    </DL>
     
    <P>
      CLX provides functions to create colormaps, access and modify colors 
      and color cells, and install colormaps in screen hardware.
