    <P>
      The X input mechanism is conceptually simple yet quite powerful. Most 
      events are attached to a particular window (that is, contain an 
      identifier for the window receiving the event). A client program can 
      receive multiple window input streams, all multiplexed over the single 
      byte-stream connection to the server.
    <P>
      Clients can tailor their input by expressing interest in only certain 
      event types. The server uses special event types to send important 
      messages to the client. For example, the client can elect to receive an 
      <A HREF='12_12_1_Keyboard_and_Pointer_Events.html#:enter-notify'><B>
      :enter-notify</B></A> event when the pointer cursor moves into a 
      certain window. Another vital message from the server is an <A
       HREF='12_12_4_Exposure_Events.html#:exposure'><B>:exposure</B></A> 
      event. This is a signal to the client indicating that at least some 
      portion of the window has suddenly become visible (perhaps the user 
      moved another window which had been overlapping it). The client is then 
      responsible for doing what is necessary to redisplay the window&#39;s 
      image. Client programs must be prepared to regenerate the contents of 
      windows in this way on demand.
    <P>
      Input is also subject to policy decisions about which client window 
      receives keyboard and pointer events. Since the pointer is free to roam 
      between windows, just clicking on a window is often enough to send a 
      pointer event to that window. Keyboard events, however, must go to a 
      keyboard focus window which has to be designated in some other way. 
      Usually, the arbiter of such input management policy is a program 
      called the <I>window</I> <I>manager</I>. The window manager gives the 
      human user a way to make a window the keyboard focus, to manage the 
      layout of windows on the screen, to represent windows with icons, and 
      so forth. In fact, the window manager client determines most of the 
      so-called look and feel of the X Window System.
