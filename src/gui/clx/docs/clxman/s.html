        <B>save set</B>
      <DD>
        The <I>save set</I> of a client is a list of other client&#39;s 
        windows that, if they are inferiors of one of the client&#39;s 
        windows at connection close, should not be destroyed and that should 
        be remapped if it is unmapped. Save sets are typically used by window 
        managers to avoid lost windows if the manager should terminate 
        abnormally.
      <DT>
        <B>scanline</B>
      <DD>
        A list of pixel or bit values viewed as a horizontal row (all values 
        having the same y coordinate) of an image, with the values ordered by 
        increasing x coordinate.
      <DT>
        <B>scanline order</B>
      <DD>
        An image represented in <I>scanline order</I> contains scanlines 
        ordered by increasing y coordinate.
      <DT>
        <A HREF='1_6_Data_Types.html#screen'><B>screen</B></A>
      <DD>
        A server can provide several independent <I>screens</I>, which 
        typically have physically independent monitors. This would be the 
        expected configuration when there is only a single keyboard and 
        pointer shared among the screens.
      <DT>
        <B>selection</B>
      <DD>
        <P>
          A <I>selection</I> can be thought of as an indirect property with 
          dynamic type. That is, rather than having the property stored in 
          the server, it is maintained by some client (the <I>owner</I>). A 
          selection is global in nature, being thought of as belonging to the 
          user (but maintained by clients), rather than being private to a 
          particular window subhierarchy or a particular set of clients. When 
          a client asks for the contents of a selection, it specifies a 
          selection <I>target type</I>. This target type can be used to 
          control the transmitted representation of the contents.
        <P>
          For example, if the selection is &#34;the last thing the user 
          clicked on&#34; and that is currently an image, then the target 
          type might specify whether the contents of the image should be sent 
          in XY Format or Z Format. The target type can also be used to 
          control the class of contents transmitted; that is, asking for the 
          looks (fonts, line spacing, indentation, and so forth) of a 
          paragraph selection, rather than the text of the paragraph. The 
          target type can also be used for other purposes; the semantics is 
          not constrained by the protocol.
      <DT>
        <B>sensitivity</B>
      <DD>
        A condition in which a user interface component of an application 
        will accept input. Conversely, when a contact is insensitive, events 
        of particular types are not dispatched to the contact and are ignored.
      <DT>
        <B>server</B>
      <DD>
        The <I>server</I> provides the basic windowing mechanism. It handles 
        IPC connections from clients, demultiplexes graphics requests onto 
        the screens, and multiplexes input back to the appropriate clients.
      <DT>
        <B>server grabbing</B>
      <DD>
        The server can be <I>grabbed</I> by a single client for exclusive 
        use. This prevents processing of any requests from other client 
        connections until the grab is complete. This is typically only a 
        transient state for such things as rubber-banding and pop-up menus, 
        or to execute requests indivisibly.
      <DT>
        <B>server resource</B>
      <DD>
        Windows, pixmaps, cursors, fonts, gcontexts, and colormaps are known 
        as resources. They all have unique identifiers associated with them 
        for naming purposes. The lifetime of a resource is bounded by the 
        lifetime of the connection over which the resource was created. See 
        resource.
      <DT>
        <B>shell</B>
      <DD>
        A composite that handles the duties required by standard conventions 
        for top-level X windows.
      <DT>
        <B>sibling</B>
      <DD>
        Children of the same parent window are known as <I>sibling</I> 
        windows.
      <DT>
        <B>static color</B>
      <DD>
        A degenerate case of pseudo color in which the RGB values are 
        predefined and read-only.
      <DT>
        <B>static gray</B>
      <DD>
        A degenerate case of gray scale in which the gray values are 
        predefined and read-only. The values are typically (near-)linear 
        increasing ramps.
      <DT>
        <B>stacking order</B>
      <DD>
        Sibling windows can <I>stack</I> on top of each other. Windows above 
        both obscure and occlude lower windows. This is similar to paper on a 
        desk. The relationship between sibling windows is known as the <I>
        stacking order</I>.
      <DT>
        <B>state</B>
      <DD>
        A slot of <B>contact</B> that controls the visual effect of the 
        contact.
      <DT>
        <B>stipple</B>
      <DD>
        A bitmap that is used to tile a region to serve as an additional clip 
        mask for a fill operation with the foreground color.
