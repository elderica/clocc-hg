    <P>
      The X Window System was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of 
      Technology (MIT) and first released in 1985. Since then, the X Window 
      System has become an industry-standard product available on virtually 
      every type of bit-mapped workstation. The current version of X, Version 
      11, has been implemented for several different computer architectures, 
      for a wide variety of display hardware, and also for many different 
      operating systems. X Version 11 represents the fulfillment of the 
      original design goals proposed by MIT, as follows:
    <DL>
      <DT>
        Portable
      <DD>
        Support virtually any bitmap display and any interactive input device 
        (including keyboards, mice, tablets, joysticks, and touch screens). 
        Make it easy to implement the window system on different operating 
        systems.
      <DT>
        Device-Independent Applications
      <DD>
        Avoid rewriting, recompiling, or even relinking in order to use 
        different display/input hardware. Make it easy for an application to 
        work on both monochrome and color hardware.
      <DT>
        Network Transparent
      <DD>
        Let an application run on one computer while using another 
        computer&#39;s display, even if the other computer has a different 
        operating system or hardware architecture.
      <DT>
        Multitasking
      <DD>
        Support multiple applications being displayed simultaneously.
      <DT>
        No User Interface Policy
      <DD>
        Since no one agrees on what constitutes the best user interface, make 
        it possible for a broad range of user interface styles (or policies) 
        to be implemented, external to the window system and to the 
        application programs.
      <DT>
        Cheap Windows
      <DD>
        Windows should be abundant, and ubiquitous. Provide overlapping 
        windows and a simple mechanism for window hierarchy.
      <DT>
        High-Performance Graphics
      <DD>
        Provide powerful interfaces for synthesizing 2-D images (geometric 
        primitives, high-quality text with multiple typefaces, and scanned 
        images).
      <DT>
        Extensible
      <DD>
        Include a mechanism for adding new capabilities. Allow separate sites 
        to develop independent extensions without becoming incompatible with 
        remote applications.
    </DL>
     
    <P>
      Some of these goals lead directly to the basic X architecture -- the 
      client-server model. The basic window system is implemented by the X <I>
      server</I> program. An application program (the <I>client</I>) sends 
      window system <I>requests</I> to the X server through a reliable 
      two-way byte-stream.
    <P>
      In general, the server and the client can be executing on separate host 
      computers, in which case the byte-stream is implemented via some 
      network protocol (TCP, DECnet<SUP>tm</SUP>, Chaosnet, and so forth). 
      The X server, which is connected to several client programs running 
      concurrently, executes client requests in round-robin fashion. The 
      server is responsible for drawing client graphics on the display screen 
      and for making sure that graphics output to a window stays inside its 
      boundary.
    <P>
      The other primary job of the X server is to channel input from the 
      keyboard, pointer, and other input devices back to the appropriate 
      client programs. Input arrives at the client asynchronously in the form 
      of input <I>events</I> representing up/down transitions of keys or 
      pointer buttons, changes in the pointer position, and so on. In some 
      cases, a request generates a return value (or <I>reply</I>) from the 
      server, which is another kind of client input. Replies and input events 
      are received via the same byte-stream connecting the client with the 
      server.
