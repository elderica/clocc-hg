        <B>callback</B>
      <DD>
        A function that represents a connection between a contact and the 
        rest of an application program. A contact calls a callback function 
        in order to report the results of the user interface component that 
        it represents.
      <DT>
        <B>children</B>
      <DD>
        First-level subwindows of a window.
      <DT>
        <B>class event</B>
      <DD>
        Event translations that belong to all instances of a contact class. A 
        class event <B>translations</B> translation is created by the <B>
        defevent</B> macro.
      <DT>
        <B>class resources</B>
      <DD>
        Resources defined for each instance of a contact class. Also see 
        constraint resources.
      <DT>
        <B>click</B>
      <DD>
        A <A HREF='12_12_1_Keyboard_and_Pointer_Events.html#:button-press'><B>
        :button-press</B></A> event followed immediately by a <A
         HREF='12_12_1_Keyboard_and_Pointer_Events.html#:button-release'><B>
        :button-release</B></A> event for the same button, with no 
        intervening change in pointer position or modifier key state.
      <DT>
        <B>client</B>
      <DD>
        An application program connects to the window system server by some 
        interprocess communication (IPC) path, such as a TCP connection or a 
        shared memory buffer. This program is referred to as a <I>client</I> 
        of the window system server. More precisely, the client is the IPC 
        path itself. A program with multiple paths open to the server is 
        viewed as multiple clients by the protocol. Resource lifetimes are 
        controlled by connection lifetimes, not by program lifetimes.
      <DT>
        <B>clipping regions</B>
      <DD>
        In a graphics context, a bitmap or list of rectangles can be 
        specified to restrict output to a particular region of the window. 
        The image defined by the bitmap or rectangles is called a <I>clipping 
        region</I>.
      <DT>
        <A HREF='1_6_Data_Types.html#colormap'><B>colormap</B></A>
      <DD>
        A set of entries defining color values. The colormap associated with 
        a window is used to display the contents of the window. Each pixel 
        value indexes the colormap to produce RGB values that drive the guns 
        of a monitor. Depending on hardware limitations, one or more 
        colormaps can be installed at one time, such that windows associated 
        with those maps display with correct colors.
      <DT>
        <B>composite</B>
      <DD>
        A subclass of <B>contact</B> representing contacts that are the 
        parents of other contacts. A composite provides geometry management 
        and input focus management services for the contacts that are its 
        children.
      <DT>
        <B>complete resource class</B>
      <DD>
        A list of symbols containing the class of the contact, the class of 
        the contact&#39;s <B>parent</B> (and so on), and the class of the <B>
        contact-display</B> to which the contact belongs. The complete 
        resource class is one of the two items used as a key by a CLUE 
        application in order to access a contact resource value in a resource 
        database.
      <DT>
        <B>complete resource name</B>
      <DD>
        A list of symbols containing the <B>name</B> of the contact, the <B>
        name</B> of the contact&#39;s <B>parent</B> (and so on), and the name 
        of the <B>contact-display</B> to which the contact belongs. The 
        complete resource name is one of the two items used as a key by a 
        CLUE application in order to access a contact resource value in a 
        resource database.
      <DT>
        <B>connection</B>
      <DD>
        The IPC path between the server and client program. A client program 
        typically has one connection to the server over which requests and 
        events are sent.
      <DT>
        <B>constraint resources</B>
      <DD>
        Resources defined for each child belonging to a member of a composite 
        class. Constraint resources are typically used to control the 
        parent&#39;s geometry management policy. Also see class resources.
      <DT>
        <B>contact</B>
      <DD>
        The basic CLUE object for programming a user interface.
      <DT>
        <B>contact-display</B>
      <DD>
        The CLUE object type that represents a connection to an X server and 
        that supports an event loop for application input.
      <DT>
        <B>contact initialization</B>
      <DD>
        The process of collecting initial values for all contact attributes. 
        No server resources (windows and so on) are actually allocated until 
        contact realization.
      <DT>
        <B>contact realization</B>
      <DD>
        The process of allocating contact resources. This process completes 
        contact creation.
      <DT>
        <B>containment</B>
      <DD>
        A window contains the pointer if the window is viewable and the hot 
        spot of the cursor is within a visible region of the window or a 
        visible region of one of its inferiors. The border of the window is 
        included as part of the window for containment. The pointer is in a 
        window if the window contains the pointer but no inferior contains 
        the pointer.
      <DT>
        <B>content</B>
      <DD>
        The single child of a shell. The basic geometry management policy 
        implemented by the <B>shell</B> class constrains a shell and its 
        content to have the same width and height; size changes to one are 
        automatically applied to the other.
      <DT>
        <B>coordinate system</B>
      <DD>
        The coordinate system has x horizontal and y vertical, with the 
        origin [0, 0] at the upper left. Coordinates are discrete and are in 
        terms of pixels. Each window and pixmap has its own coordinate 
        system. For a window, the origin is at the inside upper left, inside 
        the border.
      <DT>
        <A HREF='1_6_Data_Types.html#cursor'><B>cursor</B></A>
      <DD>
        The visible shape of the pointer on a screen. It consists of a 
        hot-spot, a source bitmap, a shape bitmap, and a pair of colors. The 
        cursor defined for a window controls the visible appearance when the 
        pointer is in that window.
