        <B>event</B>
      <DD>
        Clients receive information asynchronously via <I>events</I>. These 
        events can be either asynchronously generated from devices, or 
        generated as side effects of client requests. Events are grouped into 
        types; events are never sent to a client by the server unless the 
        client has specifically asked to be informed of that type of event, 
        but clients can force events to be sent to other clients. Events are 
        typically reported relative to a window.
      <DT>
        <B>event compression</B>
      <DD>
        Ignoring (or compressing) certain redundant input events. Compression 
        of redundant events is controlled by the class slots <B>
        compress-exposures</B> and <B>compress-motion</B>, which are shared 
        by all instances of a contact class.
      <DT>
        <B>event loop</B>
      <DD>
        The fundamental application control structure: wait for an event, 
        figure out how to handle it, process the event, then go back and wait 
        for the next one. In CLUE, the event loop is implemented using the <B>
        process-next-event</B> function.
      <DT>
        <B>event mask</B>
      <DD>
        Events are requested relative to a window. The set of event types a 
        client requests relative to a window are described using an <I>event 
        mask</I>.
      <DT>
        <B>event propagation</B>
      <DD>
        Device-related events <I>propagate</I> from the source window to 
        ancestor windows until some client has expressed interest in handling 
        that type of event, or until the event is discarded explicitly.
      <DT>
        <B>event specification</B>
      <DD>
        A notation for describing a certain sort of event. CLUE input 
        processing consists of matching an event with an event specification 
        found in a contact&#39;s <B>event-translations</B> slot and then 
        calling actions associated with the matching event specification.
      <DT>
        <B>event synchronization</B>
      <DD>
        Certain race conditions are possible when demultiplexing device 
        events to clients (in particular deciding where pointer and keyboard 
        events should be sent when in the middle of window management 
        operations). The event synchronization mechanism allows synchronous 
        processing of device events.
      <DT>
        <B>event source</B>
      <DD>
        The smallest window containing the pointer is the <I>source</I> of a 
        device related event.
      <DT>
        <B>event translation</B>
      <DD>
        The process of determining which contact action functions will be 
        executed. An event translation is a list found in a contact&#39;s <B>
        event-translations</B> slot associating an event specification with 
        one or more action names. Also see class event translations.
      <DT>
        <B>exposure event</B>
      <DD>
        Servers do not guarantee to preserve the contents of windows when 
        windows are obscured or reconfigured. <I>Exposure</I> events are sent 
        to clients to inform them when contents of regions of windows have 
        been lost.
      <DT>
        <B>extension</B>
      <DD>
        Named <I>extensions</I> to the core protocol can be defined to extend 
        the system. Extension to output requests, resources, and event types 
        are all possible, and expected.
