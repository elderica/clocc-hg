    <P>
      The X Window System supports one or more screens containing overlapping 
      windows and subwindows. A <I>screen</I> is a physical monitor and 
      hardware, which can be either color or black and white. There can be 
      multiple screens per display workstation. A single server can provide 
      display services for any number of screens. A set of screens for a 
      single user with one keyboard and one mouse is called a <I>display</I>.
    <P>
      All windows in an X server are arranged in a strict hierarchy. At the 
      top of the hierarchy are the <I>root windows</I>, which cover each of 
      the display screens. Each root window is either partially or completely 
      covered by child windows. All windows, except for root windows, have 
      parents. Any window can in turn have its own children. In this way, an 
      application program can create a window tree of arbitrary depth on each 
      screen.
    <P>
      A child window can be larger than its parent. That is, part or all of 
      the child window can extend beyond the boundaries of the parent. 
      However, all output to a window is clipped by the boundaries of its 
      parent window. If several children of a window have overlapping 
      locations, one of the children is considered to be on top of/or raised 
      over the others, <I>obscuring</I> them. Window output to areas that are 
      covered by other windows is suppressed.
    <P>
      A window has a border that is zero or more pixels in width and can be 
      any pattern (pixmap) or solid color. A window usually has a background 
      pattern that is drawn by the X server. Each window has its own 
      coordinate system. Child windows obscure their parents unless the child 
      windows have no background. Graphics operations in the parent window 
      are usually clipped by the children.
    <P>
      X also provides objects called <I>pixmaps</I> for off-screen storage of 
      graphics. Single-plane pixmaps (that is, of depth 1) are sometimes 
      referred to as <I>bitmaps</I>. Both pixmaps and windows can be used 
      interchangeably in most graphics functions. Pixmaps are also used in 
      various graphics operations to define patterns, or <I>tiles</I>. 
      Windows and pixmaps together are referred to as <I>drawables</I>.
