    <P>
      A <I>keycode</I> represents a physical (or logical) key. In CLX, 
      keycodes are values of type (<B>integer</B> 8 255). A keycode value 
      carries no intrinsic information, although server implementors may 
      attempt to encode geometry (for example, matrix) information in some 
      fashion so it can be interpreted in a server- dependent fashion. The 
      mapping between keys and keycodes cannot be changed.
    <P>
      A <I>keysym</I> is an encoding of a symbol on the cap of a key. In CLX, 
      keysyms are values of type <A HREF='1_6_Data_Types.html#card32'><B>
      card32</B></A>. The set of defined keysyms include the ISO Latin 
      character sets (1-4), Katakana, Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Technical, 
      Special, Publishing, APL, Hebrew, and miscellaneous keys found on 
      keyboards (RETURN, HELP, TAB, and so on). The encoding of keysyms is 
      defined by the X Protocol.
    <P>
      A list of keysyms is associated with each keycode. The length of the 
      list can vary with each keycode. The list is intended to convey the set 
      of symbols on the corresponding key. By convention, if the list 
      contains a single keysym and if that keysym is alphabetic and case 
      distinction is relevant, then it should be treated as equivalent to a 
      two-element list of the lowercase and uppercase keysyms. For example, 
      if the list contains the single keysym for uppercase A, the client 
      should treat it as if it were a pair with lowercase as the first keysym 
      and uppercase A as the second keysym.
    <P>
      For any keycode, the first keysym in the list should be chosen as the 
      interpretation of a key press when no modifier keys are down. The 
      second keysym in the list normally should be chosen when the <B>:shift
      </B> modifier is on, or when the <B>:lock</B> modifier is on and <B>
      :lock</B> is interpreted as <B>:shift-lock</B>. When the <B>:lock</B> 
      modifier is on and is interpreted as <B>:caps-lock</B>, it is suggested 
      that the <B>:shift</B> modifier first be applied to choose a keysym, 
      but if that keysym is lowercase alphabetic, the corresponding uppercase 
      keysym should be used instead.
    <P>
      Other interpretations of <B>:caps-lock</B> are possible; for example, 
      it may be viewed as equivalent to <B>:shift-lock</B>, but only applying 
      when the first keysym is lowercase alphabetic and the second keysym is 
      the corresponding uppercase alphabetic. No interpretation of keysyms 
      beyond the first two in a list is suggested here. No spatial geometry 
      of the symbols on the key is defined by their order in the keysym list, 
      although a geometry might be defined on a vendor-specific basis. The X 
      server does not use the mapping between keycodes and keysyms. Rather, 
      the X server stores the mapping merely for reading and writing by 
      clients.
