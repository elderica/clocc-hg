 I originally got these files with CMU-CL.  They had no document
structuring (page number) comments in them, and `gv' wouldn't let me
page around in them.  Additionally, they had been printed back to
front, making it very difficult to read them on-screen, the way I
prefer.

 I've added the page numbers.  These are all numbered; the .el file is
the XEmacs lisp program I used to number them, in case anyone wants it
for an example. :-) The `Makefile' is set up to create a DEC SRC
Lectern file from the postscript.
