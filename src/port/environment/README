CL.ENVIRONMENT 0.1

This package contains a set of definitions whose intent is to
facilitate the management of system dependencies.

In particular, many little bits and pieces of information, which are
usually represented as strings or features in a Common Lisp
implementation, are now represented as (singleton) class instances.
The idea being that now it should be "easier" to write more portable
code, by using a standardized interface.

The inspiration for this work is in the Sonya Keene's book on CLOS.

The system has been tested on

    CMUCL 18b
    Allegro CL Lite 5.01 Windows
    Lispworks Personal Edition 4.1 Windows
