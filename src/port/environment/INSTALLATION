CL.ENVIRONMENT 0.1

Installation Instructions

1. With MK:DEFSYSTEM.

You need MK:DEFSYSTEM to do everything automatically.  The system
should work only on CMUCL (and maybe Allegro).

Before doing anything, you will need to edit (sorry) the 'env.system'
file in order to have the correct :SOURCE-PATHNAME and
:BINARY-PATHNAME in place.

Start a CL *in the 'environment' directory* and do

      (load "env.system")
      (mk:compile-system 'cl.environment)

2. Without MK:DEFSYSTEM.

Load the file named 'load-cl-environment.lisp'.

      (load "load-cl-environment.lisp")

Be careful about the directory you are in and/or the actual location
of the aforementioned file.

Once the file is loaded you will have the function
LOAD-CL-ENVIRONMENT-LIBRARY at your disposal (it loaded in *PACKAGE*).
You can now issue.

      (load-cl-environment-library :directory "/where/is/the/env/library/")

This will load the library.  To actually compile it, run

      (load-cl-environment-library :directory "/where/is/the/env/library/"
                                   :compile-first-p t)

This will compile the files first and then load them.

3. Test.

You are in business.  You can check the variables

      cl.env:*common-lisp-implementation*
      cl.env:*operating-system*
      cl.env:*machine*

They should be bound to a proper class instance.  Reloading the code
does not guarantee you to maintain the same instances (yet).

You can also try the function CL.ENV:SYSTEM-INFO to get a
comprehensive printout regarding your current CL session.
