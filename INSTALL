INSTALLATION OF CLOCC

1. Set the environment variable LISPTYPE appropriately
   (currently supported types: acl43, acl5, clisp, cmucl, gcl).
   Set the environment variable CLOCC_DUMP to the space-sepated list of
   your lisps for which you want to dump images.
   E.g., ACL/Linux trial version cannot dump images,
   and CMU CL dumps multi-megabyte images,
   so you might want to set CLOCC_DUMP to "clisp",
   and change the value of LISPTYPE according to the implementation
   you are using at the moment.

2. Edit the logical hosts definitions in the file "clocc.lisp" in the
   top-level directory according to your configuration.

3. Type "make clocc-top" in the top-level directory.
   This will compile "clocc.lisp" and the "defsystem" package,
   and then either dump an image or create a single FASL with them.
   This file (image or FASL) will be used in compiling the rest of CLOCC.

4. You should be able to compile any package in CLOCC now by typing
   "make system" in the appropriate directory.
   E.g., if you want to compile "PORT" (the cross-implementation
   portability system), you do
        $ cd src/port
        $ make system
