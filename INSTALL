INSTALLATION OF CLOCC

1. Set the environment variable LISPTYPE appropriately
   (currently supported types: acl43, acl5, clisp, cmucl, gcl)

2. Edit the logical hosts definitions in the file "clocc.lisp" in the
   top-level directory according to your configuration.

3. Type "make clocc-image" in the top-level directory.
   This will compile "clocc.lisp" and the "defsystem" package,
   and then dump an image with them.
   This image will be used in compiling the rest of CLOCC.

4. You should be able to compile any package in CLOCC now by typing
   "make system" in the appropriate directory.
   E.g., if you want to compile "PORT" (the cross-implementation
   portability system), you do
        $ cd src/port
        $ make system

5. Please report bugs and ask for help on <clocc-list@lists.sourceforge.net>.
