INSTALLATION OF CLOCC

You have two options:
 + using GNU Make or
 + doing everything from your lisp prompt
It is entirely up to you what path to take.

* Using GNU Make (<http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html>)

1. Set the environment variable LISPTYPE appropriately
   (currently supported types: acl43, acl5, clisp, cmucl, gcl).
   Set the environment variable CLOCC_DUMP to the space-separated list of
   your lisps for which you want to dump images.
   E.g., ACL/Linux trial version cannot dump images,
   and CMU CL dumps multi-megabyte images,
   so you might want to set CLOCC_DUMP to "clisp",
   and change the value of LISPTYPE according to the implementation
   you are using at the moment.

2. Edit the logical hosts definitions in the file "clocc.lisp" in the
   top-level directory according to your configuration.

3. Type "make clocc-top" in the top-level directory.
   This will compile "clocc.lisp" and the "defsystem" package,
   and then either dump an image or create a single FASL with them.
   This file (image or FASL) will be used in compiling the rest of CLOCC.

4. You should be able to compile any package in CLOCC now by typing
   "make system" in the appropriate directory.
   E.g., if you want to compile "PORT" (the cross-implementation
   portability system), you do
        $ cd src/port
        $ make system

* Lisp-only

;; * compile base files
(compile-file "c:/gnu/clocc/clocc") ; or whatever ...
(load *)

;; * load the defsystem facility
;; most lisps come with "asdf"; if this fails, get it yourself from
;; https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/
(require "asdf")

;; * compile some systems
;; https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf/Configuring-ASDF-to-find-your-systems.html
(asdf:compile-system "port")
(asdf:compile-system "cllib")
(asdf:compile-system "f2cl")
...

========================================================================
Finally, now that the portions of CLOCC that you are interested
in are compiled, you should make them available on startup.
You should either dump your own images or edit init files:

;; * add to your init file:
;;   ~/.clisprc for CLISP,
;;   ~/.sbclrc for SBCL,
;;   ~/.cmucl-init.lisp for CMUCL or
;;   ~/.clinit.cl for Allegro
(load "c:/gnu/clocc/clocc") ; or whatever ...
(asdf:load-system "port")
(asdf:load-system "cllib")
...
